# DiscordThemes
Discord themes using The BetterDiscord plugin. Themes are based on the core from NFLD99's CSS..

If you like the themes, visit NFLD99's website here https://nfld99.com/ The Site also has a Theme generator that is easy to use to make your Own Themes useing NFLD99's Core... If have any questions on NFLD99's themes visit the support server found here https://nfld99.com/discord.html
 I take no credit for the core of the themes, In my themes folder you will find themes, that I edited useing NFLD99's core master css, along with Previews of the Edits. Hope you enjoy and find something you Like... If you find anything that needs to be updated/ and or fixed Please let me know By coming to server listed above..

 Thank you!
